# Staff Pre-Sale Terms

## Introduction

As a way of saying thank you to our staff, we've decided to provide former staff with the opportunity to purchase a Mare Fair badge before sales are open to the public if they meet certain criteria.  In order to be eligible, they must have staffed the prior year's convention and fulfilled their obligations as determined by their lead/manager.  Eligible former staff will be notified by e-mail prior to the staff early sale begins and given the date/time the early sale will begin.  At that time, staff will have at least 24 hours to buy their badge.

## Staff Pre-Sale Terms

- All [Terms of Sale](Terms%20of%20Sale.md) apply, **except** anything allowing badge transfers
- Any badges sold as part of the pre-sale **will be ineligible to be transferred to another person *ever*** under any circumstances
- All badges sold during the pre-sale **must contain a real name that matches a staff member eligible for the pre-sale**
- Staff may only purchase **one badge** during the pre-sale
- Buying a badge for someone other than the staff member is not allowed
- Any badges sold in violation of these terms will be refunded and cancelled
- Anyone found to be purposefully violating these terms may lose their ability to participate in future pre-sales and possibly from ever volunteering for any Mare Fair events
