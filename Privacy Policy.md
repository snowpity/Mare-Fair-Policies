## What information do we collect?
### Personal information you disclose to us

***In Short**: We collect personal information that you provide to us or our venue partner.*

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.

**Personal Information Provided by You**. The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:

- names
- phone numbers
- email addresses
- mailing addresses
- contact preferences
- billing addresses

**Personal Information Provided by You to Our Venue**. We may collect personal information you provide to our venue partner when you book a room in our block using the provided link or over the phone.  The information may include the following:

- names
- phone numbers
- email addresses
- mailing addresses
- reservation information

**Sensitive Information**. We do not process sensitive information.

**Payment Data**. We may collect data necessary to process your payment if you choose to make purchases, such as your payment instrument number, and the security code associated with your payment instrument. All payment data is handled and stored by [PayPal](https://paypal.com/). You may find their privacy notice link(s) here: [https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/paypal/privacy-full](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/paypal/privacy-full).

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

## How do we process your information?

***In Short**: We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.*

**We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services**.

## When and with whom do we share your personal information?

***In Short**: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.*

We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

- **Business Transfers**. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

## How long do we keep your information?

***In Short**: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.*

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## How do we keep your information safe?

***In Short**: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.*

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## Do we collect information from minors?

***In Short**: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.*

We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at [privacy@marefair.org](mailto:privacy@marefair.org).

## What are your privacy rights?

***In Short**: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.*

<strong><u>Withdrawing your consent</u></strong>: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "[How can you contact us about this policy?](#how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-policy)" below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at [privacy@marefair.org](mailto:privacy@marefair.org).

## Controls for Do-Not-Track features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

## Do United States residents have specific privacy rights?

***In Short**: If you are a resident of Florida, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law. More information is provided below.*
