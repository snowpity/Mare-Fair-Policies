**General Policies**: While in the Mare Fair Vendor Hall all convention rules, local, state, and federal laws must be observed. Vendors are required to adhere to the attendee [Code of Conduct](Code%20of%20Conduct.md) in addition to the vendor policies in this document. Vendors and artists agree to follow any reasonable instructions given by Mare Fair staff. All vendors and artists must have a government-issued photo ID to check into the vendor hall or artist alley and conduct sales. You must be **18** years or older to vend at the convention.

**Taxes**: All Vendors are expected to be familiar with, and legally compliant to, any federal, state, and local tax laws that may apply to them as a vendor. This includes the collecting and remitting of all applicable taxes for Florida State and Orange County. Snowpity, Inc., will not be held legally or financially responsible for any unpaid taxes or tax violations that the vendor may incur while vending at Mare Fair. Please refer to Florida Department of Revenue found at [floridarevenue.com](https://floridarevenue.com/) for more information, or to Florida Department of Revenue Publication GT-800040 ([https://floridarevenue.com/Forms_library/current/gt800040.pdf](https://floridarevenue.com/Forms_library/current/gt800040.pdf)).

**Sold Content**: Mare Fair employs what is known as a “black book” policy when it comes to the sale of mature or adult art or content. Mature or adult art or content may be sold if these items are not on public display, and kept **entirely separate** from all non mature or adult art or content. In addition, all adult art must have genitalia (defined as female nipples or any detailing/definition of male and female groin areas) covered with stickers, post-it's, opaque tape, etc. Any vendor who chooses to sell mature or adult art or content must understand that it is a legal requirement to keep the content from being viewed, sold, or otherwise exposed to anybody under the age of 18. Any instance of mature or adult art or content being viewed or sold to anybody under the age of 18, or any other violation of this policy, is cause for immediate ejection from the vendor hall and all vending privileges revoked without refund. What counts as mature or adult content is completely at the discretion of Mare Fair staff, no questions asked.

Vendors planning to sell adult merchandise at Mare Fair should have available means that purchasers can use to abide by this rule.  This may include folders, dark bags, etc.

**Please note**: Selling unlicensed, pirated, or bootleg/fake products of any nature will not be tolerated. This includes unlicensed plush from China and other products of similar nature. In addition to this, selling any item that includes work by another person from which full permission has not been obtained is strictly prohibited.

The sale of food or drink that is sold in a ‘ready to eat’ state in the vendor hall (such as bread, candy, cookies, etc.) is prohibited by our venue. This does not include prepackaged foods that are sold in a state ‘not ready to eat' (such as coffee grounds, seasoning, cake mixes, etc.).

Failure to comply with any and all takedown requests from Mare Fair staff may result in eviction from the vendor hall with or without refund. If you have any questions as to what content is considered mature or adult, please email [vendor@marefair.org](mailto:vendor@marefair.org).

**Auction, Contents, or Raffles**: Any auction, contest, or raffle must follow the laws and regulations of Orange County and the State of Florida. It is the vendor's responsibility to ensure that they are following the laws and regulations set forth by the governing body and also to provide evidence of this if requested by Mare Fair staff. If no evidence can be provided, or Mare Fair staff deems this behavior to be too disruptive or problematic, the vendor will be asked to discontinue all such activities. Snowpity, Inc., does not authorize or condone any such activities and any violations of such can result in immediate ejection from the vendor hall, with all vendor hall privileges revoked.

**Early Access**: Vendors and artists will be given early access to the vendor hall space. You must have checked in and received your badge before you can begin setting up your table. All vendors and assistants will be provided with tags (custom badge, badge ribbon, sticker, or badge backer) that signify your status as a vendor or assistant. You must display your badge and tag at all times, especially during vendor only set-up hours. No badge sharing of any kind is permitted. Each vendor and vendor assistant is required to have their own badge and tag as a means of entry.

**Cost of Tables**: Vendor hall tables **DO NOT** include convention registrations. All vendors and assistants will be required to purchase a registration in order to be able to enter the vendor hall space. Tables are standard 6 x 2-foot tables.

**Cancellations**: Each table is registered to a single vendor or artist at purchase. No purchased table may be transferred to another vendor or artist. If the owning vendor or artist needs to cancel, or back out, please email [vendor@marefair.org](mailto:vendor@marefair.org) immediately. Refunds will be observed on a case by case basis.

**Table sharing**: Table sharing is not allowed outside of those who are approved to vend. If you wish to share your table with another artist or vendor, you must either submit a joint application or email [vendor@marefair.org](mailto:vendor@marefair.org) with a request and a description of who you will be sharing your table with. Approvals of any other artist or vendor whom you wish to share a table with will be observed on a case by case basis. 

Any vendors who are sharing their table with unapproved vendors in the vendor hall are subject to immediate ejection from the vendor hall, with or without notice, and all vending privileges revoked.

**No-Shows**: If a vendor or artist fails to check in for their table by closing of the vendor hall on Friday night, they will be considered a no-show and their tables will be forfeit. No-Show tables cannot be reclaimed, and neither credit nor refund will be given for No-Show tables.

**Signage**: All business names on table signage should match the information that was used when registering for the table. For example, if “Hold Me Closer” was put down as the table name on the application but all the signs say “Tiny Dancer,” the signage must be removed. Complimentary table signage will be provided for use at the table. This signage may be kept or removed at the vendor's prerogative. Vendors and artists are requested not to move or tamper with any other Mare Fair signage.

**Structures**: Mare Fair does not impose a specific height restriction on table displays, though it must be lower than touching the ceiling. Any structure brought to display artwork or merchandise must be of sound construction. If any structure falls down, appears unstable, blocks too much light, or impedes the space of another vendor, the vendor to whom it belongs will be asked to remove it by Mare Fair staff. Displays may neither impede upon other vendor's areas nor disrupt traffic flow in case of emergency.

If you have any plans to bring additional tables or any other large structures, please email [vendor@marefair.org](mailto:vendor@marefair.org).

**Conduct**: Vendors are required to adhere to all convention conduct policies in addition to the vendor policies in this document. Behavior that is deemed to be dangerous to any persons or property is strictly prohibited.

**Noise**: Overly loud music, videos, etc. will not be tolerated in the vendor hall. If the amount of sound coming from a table is found to be disruptive to other vendors or attendees as determined by Mare Fair staff, the vendor will be asked to lower the volume or turn it off. Further noise violations may result in the vendor being removed from the vendor hall and all vending privileges revoked.
